# **App Name**: HegSync

## Core Features:

- Passive Listening Mode: Enable passive listening mode with a clear visual indicator when active. The app maintains a local, temporary, rolling audio buffer that is continuously overwritten and not sent to the cloud unless a recall command is given.
- AI-Enhanced Transcription & Summary: Use AI to enhance transcription and summarization of captured audio.  The audio buffer is sent to Google Speech-to-Text.  The transcript is then sent to an AI model for summarization and keyword extraction.
- Instant Recall & Smart Search: Display a chronological list of retrieved thoughts (transcription + summary). Implement a search function to search through saved thought transcriptions and summaries.
- Thought Bookmarking & Memory Vault: Allow users to 'Pin' thoughts to save them permanently to a dedicated Memory Vault. AI suggests categories (e.g., 'Work Idea,' 'Personal Reminder,' 'Shopping List') based on content.
- AI Thought Clarifier: Tool to refine the content. After transcription, identify and optionally remove common filler words. AI can rephrase sentences for clarity or conciseness, as well as identify potential action items.
